**Purpose**: Tracks payment transactions and financial records


### **Entity Relationships**

A User can own multiple Properties (one-to-many)
A User can make multiple Bookings (one-to-many)
A Property can have multiple Bookings (one-to-many)
A Booking has one Payment (one-to-one)
A Property can have multiple Reviews (one-to-many)
A User can write multiple Reviews (one-to-many)

### **Feature Breakdown**

**User Management**

Comprehensive user registration and authentication system that handles account creation, login/logout functionality, and profile management. This feature ensures secure access control and personalized user experiences throughout the platform.

**Property Management**

Complete property listing system allowing hosts to create, update, and manage their property listings. This includes uploading photos, setting availability calendars, pricing management, and detailed property descriptions with amenities.

**Booking System**

Robust reservation mechanism that enables users to search available properties, make bookings, and manage their reservations. The system handles date validation, pricing calculations, and booking status management from inquiry to completion.

**Payment Processing**

Secure payment integration that processes transactions, handles different payment methods, and maintains payment records. This feature ensures PCI compliance and provides users with safe and reliable payment options.

**Review System**

User feedback mechanism allowing guests to rate and review properties after their stay. This feature builds trust in the platform and helps other users make informed booking decisions while providing valuable feedback to hosts.

**Search and Filtering**

Advanced search functionality that allows users to find properties based on location, dates, price range, amenities, and other criteria. This feature improves user experience by helping them quickly find suitable accommodations.

### **API Security**

**Authentication & Authorization**

Implementation of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication and role-based access control. This ensures that only authenticated users can access protected resources and that users can only perform actions they're authorized for, protecting sensitive user data and preventing unauthorized access.

**Data Protection**

Comprehensive data encryption for sensitive information including passwords, payment details, and personal user information. Input validation and sanitization prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks, while secure HTTPS communication protects data in transit.

**Rate Limiting & Monitoring**

Implementation of API rate limiting to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks, along with comprehensive logging and monitoring systems. These measures ensure platform stability and help detect suspicious activities that could compromise system security.

**Payment Security**

PCI DSS compliant payment processing with tokenization of sensitive payment information. This protects financial data and ensures secure transaction processing, building user trust and meeting regulatory requirements.

### **CI/CD Pipeline**

**Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment Overview**

CI/CD pipelines are automated workflows that enable rapid, reliable, and consistent software delivery. They automatically test, build, and deploy code changes, reducing manual errors and ensuring that new features and bug fixes reach production quickly and safely.

**Pipeline Benefits**

CI/CD pipelines are crucial for maintaining code quality, enabling rapid development cycles, and ensuring reliable deployments. They provide automated testing, consistent environments, and rollback capabilities, which are essential for a production-ready application serving multiple users.

### **Tools & Implementation**

**GitHub Actions**: Automates testing workflows, code quality checks, and deployment processes triggered by code commits and pull requests

**Docker**: Provides containerized environments ensuring consistency between development, testing, and production stages

**Automated Testing**: Runs unit tests, integration tests, and security scans before deployment to catch issues early

**Deployment Automation**: Handles automatic deployment to staging and production environments with proper approval workflows


### **Workflow Stages**

The pipeline includes code linting, automated testing, security scanning, Docker image building, and staged deployment processes. This ensures that only tested, secure, and properly formatted code reaches production while maintaining development velocity.
